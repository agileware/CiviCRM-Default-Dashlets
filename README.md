# CiviCRM-Default-Dashlets
The DefaultDashlets CiviCRM extension creates a settings page that allows administrators to define the active
dashlets for new users based on group membership.

## Usage
Enable the extension and visit /civicrm/admin/defaultdashlets to set default dashlets by group. 

## Good to know
- Only supports groups that have *Group Type* set to *Access Control*
- Works on new users only (does not modify existing users)
